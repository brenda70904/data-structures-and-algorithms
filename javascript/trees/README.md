# Trees

### [Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)

 tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

BST store Nodes and make sure the left child is always smaller than the parent Node and right child is always larger than parent Node.

## Challenge

Create a Binary Tree that has pre-order, in-order, and post-order method to traverse the Nodes in different way.
Create a Binary Search Tree add new node to the correct location follow BST rule and has method to check if the taget value is in the BST.


## API

Tree:

- preOrder : return a array of value of each Node in `pre-order` traverse.
- inOrder : return a array of value of each Node in `in-order` traverse.
- postOrder : return a array of value of each Node in `post-order` traverse.
