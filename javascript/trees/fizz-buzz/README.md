# Challenge Summary

write a function call Tree-Fizz-Buzz, it will take a tree as argument and return a new tree. This function will determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
